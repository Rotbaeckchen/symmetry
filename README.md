تناظر (symmetry) is a gui tool to generate static and dynamic strange attractors in 2d and 3d. It is a fun project to create symmetric patterns. It uses the [Lorenz Attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) as starting point. Parameters can be adjusted via the ui and exported to xml files as well as imported. The resulting images can be exported too. The images directory contains some samples of *strange* symmetric patterns. Some patterns can be visualized in 3d interactive perspective too.
